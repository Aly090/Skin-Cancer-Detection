# Skin-Cancer-Detection
Skin Care Detection refers to the use of advanced technologies, primarily artificial intelligence (AI) and imaging software, to analyze skin conditions and recommend appropriate skincare routines or treatments. By capturing images of an individual's skin, this technology identifies various concerns such as acne, wrinkles, sun damage, and dehydration. Based on the analysis, it can then suggest tailored skincare products or routines. This personalized approach helps users address their specific skin needs, ensuring better and more efficient results. As the beauty and skincare industry continues to evolve, Skin Care Detection serves as a bridge between technology and personalized skincare, offering consumers an innovative way to achieve their skin goals.
